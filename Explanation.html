                        <p>
                            For this project each student was assigned a class in the computer science program.
                            At the end of the project the goal was to create examples, from the class we were assigned, about projects and information that we would want to show interested students and faculty.
                            I chose CIS-3623 (Web Development) and helped design the UI that you saw on the previous page.
                            My team decided to create a few simple programs to show inexperienced students and give them an idea of what they might be learning.
                            These programs included:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Checkboxes to hide and change color of text</li>
                                <li>Dynamic updates/behavior (Custom clock/calendar application)</li>
                                <li>Embedding of multimedia items (photos/video/social posts, etc.)</li>
                                <li>A simple web application to calculate student grades</li>
                            </ul>
                            This project was a great learning experience in various ways.
                            After creating the UI, linking all of the students' web pages, and implementing our UI through each class page, I learned an immense amount of the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS Syntax that helped me to build this page and even this website.
                            For now, all of the class pages are still being edited that is why all of the pages lead to here. Once those are finished I will link them properly.
