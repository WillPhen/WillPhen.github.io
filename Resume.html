                            <li>Tasked with devising and deploying a hardware token authentication for the Tulsa Police’s VPN 
                                program. The program was named “NetMotion” and does not allow native hardware authentication. 
                                We spoke and worked with techs from NetMotion and ultimately settled on using a hardware token 
                                known as “YubiKey.” From there, we set up an authentication server known as GreenRADIUS that 
                                served as a mediator between Netmotion and the hardware tokens and configured this fully between 
                                NetMotions server and client. After a brief demo period, we were given the go ahead to roll this 
                                out to over 1,000 Officers. This roll-out period took about one week and was considered successful 
                                enough that it was rolled out to Tulsa Fire as well.</li>
