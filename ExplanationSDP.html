                        <p>
                            For this project we used the Agile method and were split into two teams, one to create a Turing Test page and one for an Encryption page.
                            It was created to be presented on StemDay to potential new students to interest them in the computer science field.
                            Our teams represented OBU's computer science department for this project. 
                            If you already couldn't tell from the image on the left I was a part of the encryption team.

                        <p>
                            This project helped me to learn so much about Python, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
                            We started off by creating a simple UI to get a picture of what we wanted the page to look like.
                            After that we split the encryption methods up between us in which I received the ceaser cipher along with helping with the UI.
                            I created a local host server through python along with an encryption and decryption function.
                            My server called the functions into the service and displayed them through JSON.
                            I then was able to take the HTML UI we had been working on and link a javascript file to it.
                            This javascript file was able to listen to the HTML page when the features were being used and store those values.
                            Then use those values to build a URL to call the services from the server and translate the result into a readable value for the HTML page.
                            And finally, return the values to the HTML page.

                            <p>
                                The api services are not linked with the previous page because they were only on a local host server.
                                But to give you an idea of what the encryption services looked like I linked javascript files to the UI to make them work.
